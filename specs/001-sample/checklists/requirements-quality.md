# Requirements Quality Checklist: Personal Blog Publishing Flow

**Purpose**: Validate that the Personal Blog Publishing Flow requirements remain clear, measurable, and complete before implementation.
**Created**: 2025-11-08
**Feature**: specs/001-sample/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Compose & Draft Experience

- [ ] CHK001 Are the formatting/appearance capabilities in FR-001 and FR-009 enumerated with measurable coverage (e.g., embed types, padding/font ranges) so reviewers can confirm all required controls exist?
- [ ] CHK002 Do draft privacy requirements (FR-004, Edge Case “Draft Access Beyond Author”) specify who besides the author may access drafts, how escalations are logged, and what audit evidence is required?
- [ ] CHK003 Is the persistence contract for appearance settings (FR-009, Tasks T015–T019) explicit about preview vs. published rendering parity and failure behavior if settings are missing or invalid?

## Import & Asset Validation

- [ ] CHK004 Do FR-002 and FR-012 clearly define warning/error copy, remediation steps, and doc links for oversized MD/MDX files or referenced assets so UX writers know the exact text?
- [ ] CHK005 Are fallback rules for auto tag suggestions (Edge Case “Auto Tag Fallback Rules”, FR-003) specified for very short or multilingual drafts so manual-only workflows are unambiguous?
- [ ] CHK006 Is unsupported-format handling (FR-002) explicit about accepted extensions, MIME validation, and messaging so reviewers can tell when a format must be rejected vs. converted?

## Scheduling, Notifications & State Transitions

- [ ] CHK007 Are scheduling constraints (FR-005, FR-010, Tasks T016–T020) explicit about timezone conversion, rounding to minute precision, and how edits near publish time avoid duplicate runs?
- [ ] CHK008 Does the requirement linking `status='scheduled'` to `scheduled_time > now()` (spec + data model + T005) describe how invalid states are prevented/detected, including what happens if Supabase block fails?
- [ ] CHK009 Is the unpublish+cache-purge flow (FR-007, Edge Case “Toggling a published article back to private”) documented with SLA measurement method and rollback steps so ops can verify compliance?

## Observability, Success Metrics & Runbooks

- [ ] CHK010 Do success criteria SC-001 through SC-005 include measurement methodology (tools, sampling windows) to remove ambiguity called out in Outstanding Ambiguities?
- [ ] CHK011 Are logging/metrics requirements (OR-001/002, Tasks T018/T040) mapped to concrete fields, retention expectations, and responsible services so telemetry coverage can be audited?
- [ ] CHK012 Does OR-003 specify the runbook location, required fields (owner, rollback steps, alert routing), and approval workflow so rollout readiness can be objectively checked?
